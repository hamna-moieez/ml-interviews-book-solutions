This is a solution document to the Machine Learning Interviews Book by Chip Huyen. 

## Important Note

Before we begin, it is important that a few things are highlighted to the reader.

I prepared this manual (and still am updating) during my interview preparations for machine learning roles. This manual, mainly, contains solutions to problems in Chip Huyen's Introduction to Machine Learning Interviews book. You can read the excellent book by the author here: <a href="https://huyenchip.com/ml-interviews-book/">BOOK</a>. It has helped me refresh a lot of the concepts as I was working towards interview preparations.

### Word of Caution
Please note that I have accessed and used a lot of online resources, several google searches, sometimes ChatGPT as well, stack exchange, medium and other blog posts while writing down the solutions. I have tried to reference answers, as many I could retroactively remember; however, some might not be referenced but it is important to know that it is standing on someone's shoulders.

### A Note on Ordering of Chapters
Since many of the early chapters in the book are readings, the questions start from book's chapter \# 05 (Math) in Part II. I did reproduce the questions before writing the solution, but in case the reader wants to cross-reference, the numbering and order should be kept in mind. Simply put, the questions are in order, but this document's chapter \# 01 is the book's chapter \# 05 and so on.

### Appeal
I tried my best to write these answers as correctly as possible. But, to err is human. Therefore, in case the reader spots a mistake, typo or blatant stupidity on my part, please open a pull request and I will update the document.
